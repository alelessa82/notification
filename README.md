# Notification library via email using phpMailer

This library has the function of sending e-mail using the phpmailer library. Doing this in an uncomplicated way is essential for any system.

To install the library, run the following command:

``` sh
composer require alelessa82/notification
```

To use the library, simply require the composer to autoload, invoke the class and call the method:

``` sh
<? php

require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

USE Notification\Email;

$ email = new Email (2, "mail.host.com", "your@email.com", "your-pass", "smtp secure (tls / ssl)", "port (587)","from@email.com", "From Name");

$ email-> sendEmail ("Subject","Content","reply@email.com","ReplayName","address@email.com", "Address Name");
```

Note that the entire configuration of sending e-mail is using the magic method builder! Once the builder method has been invoked within your application, your system will be able to take the shots.
